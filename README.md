# Week 4 - Data cleaning tools

## :bangbang: Description and Topics

No two datasets require the same data cleaning in order to prepare them for analysis. A variety of tools are needed in order to perform data transformations. We will explore a variety of functions that aid in this process. Topics covered will include:

-   Utilizing conditional statements using `if_else` and `case_when`
-   Manipulating data `across` columns
-   Addressing missing data using `replace` and `replace_na`
-   Addressing missing data using `fill`
